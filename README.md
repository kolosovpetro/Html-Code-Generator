# Algorithms and Data Structures in C#

This repository is a cheat sheet on the most famous and important algorithms and data structures implemented in C#. All code snipptes got from repositories by following links.

## Sources

Every algorithm present on the site may be found in respected repository:

- [Classical Algorithms](https://github.com/kolosovpetro/Classical-Algorithms)
- [Search Algorithms](https://github.com/kolosovpetro/Search-Algorithms)
- [Sort Algorithms](https://github.com/kolosovpetro/Sort-Algorithms)
- [Tree Algorithms](https://github.com/kolosovpetro/Tree-Algorithms)
- [Graph Algorithms](https://github.com/kolosovpetro/Graph-Algorithms)

## To Do

- ~~Encapsulate route to separate entity, which takes string as parameter and converts it to path, folder, filename. Create something like new RouteEntity("Algorithm name"). It will contain folder name AlgorithmName/; Filename: algorithm_name.txt, Title: Algorithm Name~~ (done simpler way)
- ~~Format readme links~~ (done)
- ~~Implement heap sort in tree algorithms, it's missing~~ (done)
- ~~Implement (or remove bst predecessor)~~ (done)
- ~~Modify links to be Root/Algorithms/Concrete~~
- ~~Add link to previous page in htmls~~
- ~~Fix issues with generic brackets~~
- ~~Add link to current repo in footer~~ (done)
- ~~Fix links to be with normal whitespaced text~~ (done)
- ~~Add descriptions to algorithms~~ (done)
- Add complexities to algorithms
- Resize code div, so it will be without scrolls
- ~~Add algorithm source link to github~~ (done)
- ~~Add Search Algorithms~~ (done)
